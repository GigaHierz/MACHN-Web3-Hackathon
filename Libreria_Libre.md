## Problem
Marginalized communities publish and share textual resources that aid their political struggles (books, zines, articles, political texts etc.) in ways that are vulnerable to censorship and malicious interventions by bad actors and dependant on centralized file hosting providers.

## Solution
Libreria Libre is a platform for marginalized communities to store textual resources in a decentralized and permanent way, with an integrated community approval and resource upvoting/downvoting system. The funds used for approval and upvoting/downvoting get directly donated to causes fighting for the rights of these communities.
