## Problem
Marginalized communities publish and share textual resources that aid their political struggles (books, zines, articles, political texts etc.) in ways that are vulnerable to censorship and malicious interventions by bad actors and dependant on centralized file hosting providers.

## Solution
Libreria Libre is a platform for marginalized communities to store textual resources in a decentralized and permanent way, with an integrated community approval and resource upvoting/downvoting system. The funds used for approval and upvoting/downvoting get directly donated to causes fighting for the rights of these communities.

## Example Use Case
Last month (May 2023), a new law passed in Florida that makes it illegal for the majority of health institutions to provide hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for trans adults. As a result, many trans people are switching to do-it-yourself (DIY) HRT. Guides to doing safe DIY HRT circulate on the social media and it would profit the trans community to have a decentralized, censorship-resistant and free access to such guides.
